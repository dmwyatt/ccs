# CCS Roadmap

Feature ideas and enhancements. Not prioritized or committed - just a place to capture ideas.

## Stats Enhancements

- [ ] `--by-day` flag for daily breakdown (module already supports it)
- [ ] `--json` output format for programmatic consumption
- [ ] Token estimates per conversation (would need tiktoken or similar)
- [ ] Lines of code stats (data already tracked: `total_lines_added`, `total_lines_removed`)
- [ ] Model usage breakdown (which models used, message counts per model)
- [ ] Time-of-day patterns (when do conversations happen)
- [ ] Conversation duration estimates

## General Enhancements

- [ ] `--json` output format across all commands
- [ ] Rich text formatting display improvements
- [ ] Code block extraction and display
- [ ] HTML export format
- [ ] Conversation deletion/archiving
- [ ] Multiple Cursor profile support

## Search Enhancements

- [ ] Regex search support
- [ ] Search by model
- [ ] Search by date range (alternative to --since/--before)
- [ ] Full-text search indexing for large databases
